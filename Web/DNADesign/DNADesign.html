                <p> We use the polymerase reaction as a way to absorb ATP from cells.<br>
                    The polymerase is an enzyme which configuers a nucleic acid or a chain such as DNA or RNA.<br>
                    In this project, we use double stranded DNA including T7 promoter squence as template,<br>
                    NTP(Nucleoside triphosphate) as substrate.<br>
                    In addition to, we use T7RNA polymerase which is an enzyme and makes complementary single stranded RNA<br>
                    for a template DNA being a part of downstream of the promoter(Figure 1,Video 1).<br><br>

                <h2>About ON-OFF switch</h2>
                <p> We arranged adenine on a part of downstream of the T7 promoter to absorb only ATP as energy(Figure 2).<br>
                    In addition to, we tyied to implement below three systems.<br><br>

                <p> &middot;&nbsp;amplification gate<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;We need high concentration DNA to stop the effect of cells.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If we implement the amplification gate, we are able to kill cells which have amount of ATP.<br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;T7RNA polymerase recognizes double stranded DNA such as Figure 3(a) and starts a reaction with it.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we set double stranded DNA state such as Figure 3(a) as switch ON state,<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;and single stranded DNA state such as Figure 3(b) as switch OFF state.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Thereby we are able to switch ON-OFF state of polymerase reaction.<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If we implement the feedback regulator, we are able to keep level of ATP.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;In addtion to, the scope of application will be wider.<br><br>
                </p>

                <p> A purpose of our project is to not adversely affect to normal cells. So, we implemented the ON-OFF switch in this time.<br>
                    Thereby when cancer cells die, the circuits in normal cells is turned off by the ON-OFF switch.<br>
                    Thus it do not load more than necessary. A scheme of ON-OFF switch circuit is shown in Figure 4.<br><br>
                </p>
                Figure 4<br><br>

                <p> We designed the ON-OFF switch based on strand displacement reactions.<br>
                    This gate was composed of four DNA strand displacement reaction processes.<br>
                    Each of these reaction processes is explained below.<br><br>

                    First Process:<br>
                    First, the circuit starts by administering Input.<br>
                    In the first process, we aimed to make the models of Signal1 and Signal2<br>
                    using a strand displacement reaction(Figure 5,Figure 6).<br>
                    Thereby Signal1 output and singl stranded DCC cause hybridization and they change double stranded.<br>
                    In other words, DCC is changed ON state into OFF state.<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;&nbsp;T0* of Gate1 is bound with T0 of Input.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9313;&nbsp;Gate1 and Input are effectively combined.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9314;&nbsp;A part of Gage1 separates from the complex.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9315;&nbsp;Signal1, Signal2, and Waste are generated by separating the components.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9316;&nbsp;DCC(ON) is generated by DCC(OFF) and Signal1(Figure 6).<br><br>
                </p>
                <img src="Image/1/Gate1&Input.gif" width="70%" height="auto"><br>

                Figure 6<br><br>

                <p> Second Process:<br>
                    In the second process, we control a reacion by a gate of threshold value.<br>
                    A threshold value is decided by Threshold. Moreover, Signal2 and Threshold meet and cause<br>
                    a strand displacement reaction and then Signal2 disappear.<br>
                    In other words, we need Signal2 which over a concentration of Threshold to advance a reaction(Figure 7).<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;&nbsp;T3* of Threshold is bound with T3 of Signal2.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9313;&nbsp;Thresold and Signal2 are effectively combined.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9314;&nbsp;A part of Waste and Fuel separates from the complex.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9315;&nbsp;Waste and Fuel are genarated by separating the conponents.<br><br>
                </p>

                Figure 7<br><br>
                <p> Signal2 which over a concentration of Threshold goes Third process,<br>
                    and Fule which made in this process is used in Third process.<br><br>
                </p>

                <p> Third Process:<br>
                    In the third process, we perform processing by chain reaction of strand displacement reaction<br>
                    called seesaw gate(Figure 8,Figure 9).<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;&nbsp;&nbsp;T3* of Gate2 is bound with T3 of Signal2.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9313;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gate2 and Signal2 are effectively combined.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9314;&nbsp;&nbsp;A part of Releaser and Gate3 separates from the complex.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9315;&nbsp;&nbsp;Releaser and Gate3 are genarated by separating the conponents.<br><br>

                    Gate2 which made in previous steps causes a strand displacement reaction with Fuel, and Signal2 is made again.<br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;'&nbsp;T2* of Fule is bound with T2 of Gate3.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9313;'&nbsp;Fuel and Gate3 are effectively combined.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9314;'&nbsp;A part of Signal2 and Gate4 separates from the complex.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9315;'&nbsp;Signal2 and Gate4 are genarated by separating the conponents.<br><br>

                    The cycle such as this is called seesaw gate. Furthermore, it refills Signal2 which is consumed in Second process<br>
                    and outputs Releaser.<br>
                    As described above, Threshold and seesaw gate are used to adjust time between ON and OFF of DCC.<br><br>
                </p>

                Figure 9<br><br>
                <p>
                </p>

                <p> Final Process:<br>
                    In the final process, we aimed to change double stranded DCC into single stranded DCC<br>
                    by dissociating Signal1 from double stranded DCC.<br>
                    In other words, we aimed to swich a state of the circuit ON state to Off state(Figure 10).<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;&nbsp;T1 of DCC(ON) is bound with T1* of Releaser.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9313;&nbsp;DCC(ON) and Releaser are effectively combined.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9314;&nbsp;A part of DCC(ON) separates from the complex(It is Signal1).<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9315;&nbsp;DCC(OFF) and Waste are genarated by separating the components.<br><br>
                </p>
                <img src="Image/4/T7Promoter(ON)&Releaser.gif" width="70%" height="auto"><br>
                Figure 10<br><br><br>

                <p> According to previous four processes, we are able to switch a state of the circuit(<b>OFF → ON → OFF</b>)<br>
                    by once administering Input.<br><br>

                    However, Figure 4 has two ploblems.<br>
                    First, the circuit causes an undesired reaction when it starts.<br>
                    For instans, we explain about Input and DCC(OFF) here.<br>
                    After Input is administered, Input and DCC(OFF) may happen hybridization,<br>
                    because a part of their base sequences is complementary.<br>
                    We should change their domains to not happen hybridization.<br>
                    However, it is impossible in principle because we should change domains of Signal1 and Gate1_under in response to Input.<br>
                    The circuit remaining the same causes below three undesired reactions.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9312;&nbsp;Input binds with DCC(OFF)<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9313;&nbsp;Signal1 binds with Signal2<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&#9314;&nbsp;Input binds with Gate2<br><br>

                    Second, some double stranded DNA make T7RNA promoter<br>
                    and happen polymerase reaction without switch ON state(Figure 11).<br>
                </p>
                Figure 11<br><br>

                <p> Therefore, We used <b>mismatched base pair</b> to solve these problems.<br></p>

                <h2>What is mismatch</h2>
                <p> A&amp;T and C&amp;G in DNA base are held each other by hydrogen-bonding which is so-called Watson-Crick base pair,<br>
                    but other than that it is reported that there are other combinations (e.g. A and G ).<br>
                    We call this <b>Mismatched base pair</b>.<br>
                </p>

                </p>

                <p><b>(m1)Input&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;DCC(OFF)</b><br>
                    As previously stated, Input and DCC(OFF) are complementary, so they cause hybridization.<br>
                    We added mismatched base pair here(Figure xx). Its result of NUPACK is shown in Figure xx.<br>
                    red characters show desired reactions(The same hereinafter).<br><br>

                    They shold be completely complementary, unlike (m1).<br>
                    We added mismatched base pair to Signal1 is bound with DCC(Figure xx).<br>

                    In additon to, T7RNA promoter is disappeared without switch ON state by adding mismatched base pair<br>
                    and these problems are solved(Figuer xx).<br>
