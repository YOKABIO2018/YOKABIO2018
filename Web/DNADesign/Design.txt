First Process:
	In the first process, we aimed to make the models of Signal1, Signal2 and Waste using a strand displacement reaction.
	
	1.T2* of Gate1 is bound with T2 of Input.
	2.Gate1 and Input are effectively combined.
	3.A part of Gage1 separates from the complex.
	4.Signal1, Signal2, and Waste are generated by separating the components.
	
Second Process:
	In the second process, we aimed to meke the model of T7promoter(ON).
	This process use T7promoter(OFF) and Signal1 whitch was produced in the first process.
	
	1.a* and b* of T7promoter(OFF) are bound with a and b of Signal1.
	2.T7promoter(ON) is generated by T7promoter(OFF) and Signal1.
	
Third Process:
	
	
Fourth Process:
	In the fourth process, we aimed to make the models of Releaser and Waste using a strand displacement reaction,
	similar to the first process.
	This process use Gate2 and Signal2 witch was produced in the first process.
	
	1.T3* of Gate2 is bound with T3 of Signal2.
	2.Gate2 and Signal2 are effectively combined.
	3.A part of Gate2 separates from the complex.
	4.Releaser and Waste are genarated by separating the conponents.
	
Fifth Process:
	In the fifth process, we aimed to make the models of T7promoter(OFF) and Waste using a strand displacement reaction, similar to the first process.
	This process use T7promoter(ON) witch was produced in the second process and Releaser witch was produced in the fourth process.
	
	1.T1 of T7promoter(ON) is bound with T1* of Releaser.
	2.T7promoter(ON) and Releaser are effectively combined.
	3.A part of T7promoter(ON) separates from the complex.
	4.T7promoter(OFF) and Waste are genarated by separating the components.
